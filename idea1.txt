Air Crash Beacon App To be used to locate air crashes (best example is to locate missing planes like MH370) or missing people trapped.
The app shall be triggered by severe and continuous vibrations like a plane crash.
Then the app emits signal/pulse that can be detected by scanners. 
And as battery life for phones continues to lengthen, this app can work for days if not weeks. 
The usage is based on crowd sourcing where if 10 out of 250 passengers on the plane use the app, 
	search and rescue operation will have an easier way to detect 10 beacons rather than one 
	(even if some phones are destroyed in the crash, some might survived).
So if the pilots and 8 crews use this app, you already got 10 beacons!
Knowing that time is critical when saving lives and search and rescue operations can cost millions of dollars, this app can save both lives and money.
The only issue is that you have to keep your phone in waterproof covers.
